Please write a representation of a deck of cards.

The Deck class should contain three public methods:

// shuffles the deck
public void shuffle();

// draw a number of cards from the deck.  The end result is that the
// cards returned are removed from the deck.
public List<Card> draw(int howMany);

// draw a number of cards from the deck in sorted order.  The end  
// result is that the cards returned are removed from the deck.
public List<Card> drawSorted(int howMany); 

Cards should be first sorted by suit and then by face value (where aces are always high).

Please include unit tests.
